<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello I'm Warren</p>

<p>I'm a South African Web3 Developer that has been travelling the world from the age of 18. 
  I've lived in several countries and I'm currently living in the beautiful South East Asian country of Vietnam. 
  I first moved to Vietnam in 2018. I've explored the country from top to bottom and settled in Ho Chi Minh City.
  Here I met my beautiful wife Linh and we were married in Febuary 2023. </p>

<p>I'm currently 41 years old and I've decided to start a new career in the exciting field of Web3 Development, with the goal of becoming
  the first ever Smart Contract Developer in my family. I'm so excited to expand my knowledge and use my vast life experience to further the field.
   Join me on my journey to becoming the best Web3 Developer I can be.</p>
